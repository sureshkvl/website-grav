The work gets completed before the deadline with their assistance, if we are seriously showing interest on the project. Knetsolutions gave a friendly environment while teaching about stuffs given by them to the project and also during clarifying the doubts. It was an awesome journey with knetsolutions being a pillar support for completion of project and very thankful for assisting during the hardships of my project."

	  text: "knetsolutions is probably the best solution I've ever had in a topic of Software-Defined Networking. The course covers the vast subject of networking, the way it is going it marvelous and very helpful. Although the content is very difficult for me when I read the books, the lecturer Mr. Suresh Kumar made it easy to understand. The lecturer clearly understands his subject, and made the content well suited for novice to advanced student. The lectures are very interesting, lecturer explains his Course so well, very nice, quite interesting, refreshing and not boring; beside the lecturer is so friendly and approachable with his students. The course has broaden my understanding, and gained me a wide range of information in Software-Defined Networking. I mostly like the fact that the arguments are explained in detail so that, I would recommend the course to people who are interested in the module can get an important contribution to their knowledge and in their research topic."
