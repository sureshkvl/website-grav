	  text: "knet solutions is probably the best solution I've ever had in a topic of Software-Defined Networking. Although the content is very difficult for me when I read the books, the lecturer Mr. Suresh Kumar made it easy to understand. The lecturer clearly understands his subject, and made the content well suited for novice to advanced student."
